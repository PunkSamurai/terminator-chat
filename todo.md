1) have nice file structure (DONE)

2) actually write some code (need our own header files and binaries and other cool stuff)

3) cool GUI with terminator reference ofc

4) slap on docker and cmake and whatnot (whatever that means)

5) as a bonus, add protocols for server discovery, DMs, and file transfer within a server
